# ZeroMQ (ZMQ)

[ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) (also spelled `Ã˜MQ`, `0MQ` or `ZMQ`) is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in `distributed` or `concurrent` applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, *a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker.*

ZeroMQ supports common messaging patterns (`pub/sub`, `request/reply`, `client/server` and others) over a variety of transports (`TCP`, `in-process`, `inter-process`, `multicast`, `WebSocket` and more), making inter-process messaging as simple as inter-thread messaging. This keeps your code clear, modular and extremely easy to scale.
