# Divide and Conquer

Solve a problwm recursively

## Three steps

1. Divide

    ```
    Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem. 
    ```

2. Conquer
    
    ```
    Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively.
    ```

    - Base case (Termination condition): Solve the subproblems if the subproblem sizes are small enough.

    - Recursive case: Recursively solve itself.

3. Combine

    ```
    Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
    ```
