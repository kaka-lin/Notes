# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

#### Discription

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

#### Example:

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

## Solution: Recursion

- Runtime: ms (%)
- Memory Usage: MB (%)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, t1: TreeNode, t2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:      
        if t1 is None:
            return t2
        if t2 is None:
            return t1
        
        t1.val += t2.val
        t1.left = self.mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left)
        t1.right = self.mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right)
        
        return t1
```

### Time complexity

- O(m), A total of mm nodes need to be traversed. Here, mm represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.

### Space complexity

- O(m), The depth of the recursion tree can go upto mm in the case of a skewed tree. In average case, depth will be O(logm)
