# Divide and Conquer

`Divide and Conquer` is an `algorithm design paradigm`. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

```
Breaks down a problem into sub-problem,
Solve sub-problwm recursively.
```

## Three steps

1. Divide

    ```
    Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
    ```

2. Conquer

    ```
    Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively.
    ```

    - Base case (Termination condition): Solve the subproblems if the subproblem sizes are small enough.

    - Recursive case: Recursively solve itself.

3. Combine

    ```
    Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
    ```
